Every project has a beautiful feature shocase page. It's easy to include images, in a flexible 3-column grid format. Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.
To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:<br><br>




<br><br><br><br><h1><strong>1. 타이틀 화면</strong></h1><br>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.<br><br>

<div class="img_row">

Every project has a beautiful feature shocase page. It's easy to include images, in a flexible 3-column grid format. Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so: 

	---
	layout: post
	title: Project
	description: a project with a background image
	img: /img/12.jpg
	---


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/capstone/title.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	주석
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.

</div>
